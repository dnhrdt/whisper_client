  "details": [
    "Discovered that individual tests pass when run in isolation but fail when run as a test suite",
    "Identified mock implementation issues in the WebSocket tests",
    "Found that the MockWebSocket class lacked access to the client_id, causing errors during cleanup",
    "Identified session ID generation issues that could lead to non-unique IDs",
    "Fixed session ID generation to ensure uniqueness with randomization",
    "Created a more robust mock WebSocket object with proper client_id access",
    "Improved the mock_connect function to properly support cleanup",
    "Fixed the test_client_and_session_ids test to verify session ID changes",
    "Updated websocket_timing_dependencies.md with new findings and recommendations",
    "Added a new section on 'Test Suite Integration Issues'",
    "Documented mock implementation issues, test isolation issues, session ID generation issues, and resource cleanup issues",
    "Provided recommendations for addressing each issue",
    "Outlined next steps for completing test verification and implementing fixes",
    "Verified that the test_client_and_session_ids test now passes successfully",
    "Verified that the test_instance_tracking test now passes successfully",
    "Identified that some tests may still hang when run in sequence"
