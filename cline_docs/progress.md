2. **Testing Philosophy Established**
   - New testing axiom: "The test framework is a tool, not a deliverable"
   - Pragmatic approach adopted
   - Focus on essential testing only
   - Manual verification preferred for straightforward features
   - Comprehensive testing reserved for complex issues

3. **Core Functionality**
   - WebSocket client with auto-reconnect [T121]
   - Audio recording and normalization [T122]
   - Basic text output system [T123]
   - Logging system with rotation [T124]

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Base configuration system
   - Development environment
   - Test framework structure
   - Error handling patterns
