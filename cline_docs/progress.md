3. **WebSocket Test Suite Integration Issues Analysis** ✓
   - Investigation Findings
     * Discovered that individual tests pass when run in isolation but fail when run as a test suite
     * Identified mock implementation issues in the WebSocket tests
     * Found that the MockWebSocket class lacked access to the client_id, causing errors during cleanup
     * Identified session ID generation issues that could lead to non-unique IDs
     * Discovered resource cleanup issues between tests
   - Implemented Fixes
     * Fixed session ID generation to ensure uniqueness with randomization
     * Created a more robust mock WebSocket object with proper client_id access
     * Improved the mock_connect function to properly support cleanup
     * Fixed the test_client_and_session_ids test to verify session ID changes
   - Documentation
     * Updated websocket_timing_dependencies.md with new findings and recommendations
     * Added a new section on "Test Suite Integration Issues"
     * Documented mock implementation issues, test isolation issues, session ID generation issues, and resource cleanup issues
     * Provided recommendations for addressing each issue
     * Outlined next steps for completing test verification and implementing fixes
   - Verification
     * Verified that the test_client_and_session_ids test now passes successfully
     * Verified that the test_instance_tracking test now passes successfully
     * Identified that some tests may still hang when run in sequence
   - Task History
     * Created log entry with analysis details [T147]
     * Updated Memory Bank documentation
