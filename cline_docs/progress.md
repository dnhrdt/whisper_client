## Current Focus: Research & Investigation

### Recently Completed
1. **Test Migration Phase 3**
   - Simplified Test Runner ✓
     * Basic category support implemented
     * Essential timing test functionality preserved
     * Documentation created in /tests/docs/test_runner_usage.md
     * Minimal maintenance overhead achieved
     * Ready for organic evolution during development
   - Testing Philosophy Applied ✓
     * "Test framework is a tool, not a deliverable" validated
     * Pragmatic approach proven effective
     * Framework ready to evolve with development needs
     * Premature optimization avoided

1. **Test Migration Phase 1 & 2**
   - Documentation & Planning ✓
     * All active documentation translated to English
     * Memory Bank structure fully implemented
     * Documentation committed to GitHub
     * Added .gitattributes for line endings
     * German test cases preserved intentionally
     * Test documentation migrated to /docs/testing/
     * Migration roadmap established
     * Test output messages standardized to English
     * Language policy documented in test inventory
     * Test inventory created with coverage gaps identified

   - Basic Reorganization ✓
     * Created /docs/testing/ directory
     * Moved and updated all test documentation
     * Created test directory structure:
       - /tests/timing/ (Priority 1)
       - /tests/integration/ (Priority 2)
       - /tests/speech/ (Priority 3)
       - /tests/poc/ (preserved)
     * Added README files to all directories
     * POC integration planned and documented
     * Files migrated to new structure
     * Import paths updated
     * Original files removed after verification

2. **Testing Philosophy Established**
   - New testing axiom: "The test framework is a tool, not a deliverable"
   - Pragmatic approach adopted
   - Focus on essential testing only
   - Manual verification preferred for straightforward features
   - Comprehensive testing reserved for complex issues

3. **Core Functionality**
   - WebSocket client with auto-reconnect [T121]
   - Audio recording and normalization [T122]
   - Basic text output system [T123]
   - Logging system with rotation [T124]

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Base configuration system
   - Development environment
   - Test framework structure
   - Error handling patterns

### Current Tasks
1. **WhisperLive Server Research**
   - [ ] Document current understanding
   - [ ] Investigate output format
   - [ ] Research processing parameters
   - [ ] Analyze batch processing strategy
   - [ ] Study connection handling

2. **Similar Applications Analysis**
   - [ ] Identify relevant projects
   - [ ] Review implementations
   - [ ] Compare features
   - [ ] Extract best practices
   - [ ] Document findings

3. **Test Migration (Phase 3: Test Runner)** ✓
   - [x] Create unified test runner
   - [x] Add category support
   - [x] Preserve essential capabilities
   - [x] Add minimal configuration (--verbose)
   - [x] Document usage in test_runner_usage.md

4. **Test Migration (Phase 4: Implementation)** [Deferred]
   - Deferred for organic evolution during development
   - Tests will be created/updated as specific needs arise
   - Focus on solving real problems over test infrastructure
   - Following "test framework is a tool" philosophy

5. **Audio Processing**
   - [ ] Tumbling Window implementation (planned)
   - [ ] Queue-based management
   - [ ] Audio segmentation
   - [ ] Performance optimization

6. **Text Processing**
   - [ ] Windows API integration
   - [ ] Memory-based buffering
   - [ ] SendMessage implementation
   - [ ] Performance testing

### Known Issues
1. **Server Communication**
   - Internal buffer size unknown
   - Processing triggers not documented
   - Batch processing unclear
   - Connection stability needs improvement

2. **Audio Processing**
   - Timing problems [T120]
   - Buffer optimization needed
   - See docs/investigations/timing_202502.md

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation incomplete
   - Some diagrams need translation
   - See docs/todo/documentation.md

## Next Steps
1. Begin WhisperLive server research
2. Analyze similar applications
3. Document findings
4. Plan implementation improvements

Note: Development will be guided by research findings. The test framework will evolve naturally as specific needs arise during development.
