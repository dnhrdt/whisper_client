# Development Progress
Version: 1.1
Timestamp: 2025-02-26 19:57 CET

## Current Focus: Core Stability & Documentation Refinement

### Recently Completed
1. **Documentation Migration**
   - All active documentation translated to English
   - Memory Bank structure fully implemented
   - Config file standardized and translated
   - Historical German files preserved
   - Documentation hierarchy established

2. **Core Functionality**
   - WebSocket client with auto-reconnect [T121]
   - Audio recording and normalization [T122]
   - Basic text output system [T123]
   - Logging system with rotation [T124]

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Base configuration system
   - Development environment
   - Test framework structure
   - Error handling patterns

### Current Tasks
1. **Memory Bank**
   - [x] Create all Memory Bank files
   - [x] Validate content structure
   - [x] Check cross-references
   - [x] Review completeness
   - [x] Integrate documentation

2. **Audio Processing**
   - [ ] Tumbling Window implementation (planned)
   - [ ] Queue-based management
   - [ ] Audio segmentation
   - [ ] Performance optimization

3. **Text Processing**
   - [ ] Windows API integration
   - [ ] Memory-based buffering
   - [ ] SendMessage implementation
   - [ ] Performance testing

### Known Issues
1. **Audio Processing**
   - Timing problems [T120]
   - Buffer optimization needed
   - See docs/investigations/timing_202502.md

2. **Documentation**
   - API documentation incomplete
   - Some diagrams need translation
   - See docs/todo/documentation.md

3. **Testing**
   - Timing tests not implemented
   - Integration tests pending
   - See tests/test_architecture.md

## Next Steps
1. Complete Memory Bank setup
2. Implement timing test framework
3. Document server parameters
4. Adjust client timing
