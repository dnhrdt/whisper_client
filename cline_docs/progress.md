## Current Focus: Test Framework Improvement

### Recently Completed
1. **Documentation Migration & GitHub Integration**
   - All active documentation translated to English
   - Memory Bank structure fully implemented
   - Documentation committed to GitHub
   - Added .gitattributes for line endings
   - German test cases preserved intentionally

2. **Core Functionality**
   - WebSocket client with auto-reconnect [T121]
   - Audio recording and normalization [T122]
   - Basic text output system [T123]
   - Logging system with rotation [T124]

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Base configuration system
   - Development environment
   - Test framework structure
   - Error handling patterns

### Current Tasks
1. **Test Framework Restructuring (Phase 2)**
   - [ ] Implement directory structure from test_architecture.md
   - [ ] Review and organize existing test files
   - [ ] Update test progress tracking
   - [ ] Maintain German focus for speech recognition
   - [ ] Implement timing test framework

2. **Audio Processing**
   - [ ] Tumbling Window implementation (planned)
   - [ ] Queue-based management
   - [ ] Audio segmentation
   - [ ] Performance optimization

3. **Text Processing**
   - [ ] Windows API integration
   - [ ] Memory-based buffering
   - [ ] SendMessage implementation
   - [ ] Performance testing

### Known Issues
1. **Audio Processing**
   - Timing problems [T120]
   - Buffer optimization needed
   - See docs/investigations/timing_202502.md

2. **Documentation**
   - API documentation incomplete
   - Some diagrams need translation
   - See docs/todo/documentation.md

3. **Testing**
   - Timing tests not implemented
   - Integration tests pending
   - See tests/test_architecture.md
