## Current Focus: Core Stabilization & Refinement (CLI-First Strategy)

### Recently Completed (Last 3 Tasks)
1.  **Addressed Pylint Warnings & Updated Headers** ⚠️ [T156] (Current Session)
    *   Implementation Details
        *   Addressed specific `pylint` warnings (`W1203`, `I1101`, `R1702`, `C0201`, `W0612`) across multiple Python files (`src/audio.py`, `src/hotkeys.py`, `src/logging.py`, `src/terminal.py`, `src/text.py`, `src/utils.py`, `src/websocket.py`, `main.py`).
        *   Updated `.pylintrc` to ignore `I1101` for `win32` modules.
        *   Refactored code in `src/hotkeys.py` and `src/websocket.py` to resolve `R1702`.
        *   Updated `Version` and `Timestamp` headers in all modified Python files.
    *   Impact
        *   Resolved a significant number of `pylint` warnings, improving code quality.
        *   Updated file headers for better tracking.
    *   **New Issues:** Final linting run after `black` reformatting revealed new `mypy`/`pylint` errors (`E1205`/`E1121`), likely due to incorrect logging format changes applied to custom helper functions. These need correction in the next session.
    *   Task History
        *   (Log entry to be created for this session)
        *   Updated Memory Bank documentation (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

2.  **Implemented Streamlined Linting System** ✓ [T156]
    *   Implementation Details
        *   Created a centralized PowerShell linting script (.linting/lint.ps1) with flexible options:
            - Support for running specific linters or all of them
            - Ability to target specific files
            - Fix mode for automatic corrections
            - Clear, color-coded output
        *   Added configuration files for all linting tools:

            - .pylintrc: Comprehensive Pylint configuration with sensible disables
            - .pre-commit-config.yaml: Git hooks for automated checks
            - pyproject.toml: Tool-specific configurations for black, isort, mypy, and pytest
        *   Created documentation for the linting system in .linting/README.md

### Current Tasks (Focus on Core Stability)

1.  **Complete Code Quality Checks** ⚠️ [T156]
    *   [x] Set up code quality tools and documentation
    *   [x] Run flake8 linting tool and fix identified issues
    *   [x] Implement streamlined linting system
    *   [x] Address specific `pylint` warnings (`W1203`, `I1101`, `R1702`, `C0201`, `W0612`)
    *   [x] Update headers in modified files
    *   [ ] **Fix new `mypy`/`pylint` errors** (`E1205`/`E1121`) introduced by `black` reformatting (Next Session).
    *   [ ] Run `./.linting/lint.ps1` until all tools pass cleanly (Next Session).
    *   [ ] Re-verify all project file headers after fixes (Next Session).

2.  **Core Stability Analysis & Improvement** ⚠️ [NEW - TBD]
    *   [ ] Systematically review and address known stability concerns (ref: T120 Audio Timing, WebSocket connection handling, error recovery, resource leaks).
    *   [ ] Conduct tests focused on long-running stability.
    *   [ ] Prioritize specific stability issues after linting is complete.

3.  **Configuration Refinement (Planning)** ⚠️ [NEW - TBD]
    *   [ ] Evaluate current `config.py`/`config.json` setup for CLI/library usage.
    *   [ ] Propose and plan migration to a simpler, standard configuration format (e.g., TOML or YAML).

4.  **Plan Module Splitting** ⚠️ [NEW - TBD]
    *   [ ] Create a new task to address user feedback regarding splitting `src/text.py` and `src/websocket.py`.
    *   [ ] Analyze dependencies and propose a splitting strategy.

*(Note: Tasks related to broader Alpha Release (Community prep, WhisperLive comms), specific test improvements (T145), and immediate feature work (Audio Opt, Text Enhancements) are deferred until the core is stable. See `archiveContext.md` for details.)*

### Known Issues
1. **Linting**
   - New `mypy`/`pylint` errors (`E1205`/`E1121`) after `black` reformatting, likely due to incorrect logging format changes.
2. **Server Communication**
   - Internal buffer size unknown
   - Processing triggers not documented
   - Batch processing unclear
   - Connection stability needs improvement
3. **Audio Processing**
   - Timing problems [T120]
   - Buffer optimization needed
   - See docs/investigations/timing_202502.md
4. **Testing**
   - WebSocket test suite integration issues [T147]
     * Individual tests pass when run in isolation but fail when run as a test suite
     * Some tests may hang when run in sequence
     * Resource cleanup issues between tests
   - WebSocket multiple connections test is failing or hanging [T145]
     * Need to fix the test approach or implementation
5. **Documentation**
   - API documentation incomplete
   - Some diagrams need translation
   - See docs/todo/documentation.md

## Development Log References
- Current increment: (To be created: log_035.json)
- Recent major changes: logs/main.json
- Full task history: progressHistory.md

## Next Steps (Immediate for New Session)
1.  **Fix New Linting Errors [T156]:** Execute `./.linting/lint.ps1`, analyze errors (likely related to logging arguments), fix them in the affected files (esp. `src/websocket.py`), and re-run the script until clean.
2.  **Verify Headers:** Briefly re-check headers in files modified during the fix process.
3.  **Proceed with Stability Analysis:** Once T156 is truly complete, move to the next core stabilization tasks.
4.  **Prioritize Stability:** Begin systematic review and improvement of core component stability (Audio, WebSocket, Text Processing, Error Handling) after linting.
