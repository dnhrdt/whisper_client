## Document Purpose
This file archives historical development contexts that are no longer active but may be referenced for context. It reduces context load in activeContext.md while preserving complete project history.

## Access Guidelines
This archive should only be accessed when:
- Investigating regression bugs with historical roots
- Researching the rationale behind past architectural decisions
- Specifically requested by the user
- Current documentation explicitly references archived information
- Working on components that haven't been modified in multiple phases
