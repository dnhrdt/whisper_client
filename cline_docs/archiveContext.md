# Archive of Development Context
Version: 1.0
Timestamp: 2025-03-07 22:21 CET

## Document Purpose
This file archives historical development contexts that are no longer active but may be referenced for context. It reduces context load in activeContext.md while preserving complete project history.

## Access Guidelines
This archive should only be accessed when:
- Investigating regression bugs with historical roots
- Researching the rationale behind past architectural decisions
- Specifically requested by the user
- Current documentation explicitly references archived information
- Working on components that haven't been modified in multiple phases

## Phase 1: Server Communication Stability & Documentation (2025-01 to 2025-03)

### Strategic Development Decisions
- Prioritize application progress over test perfection
- Focus on core functionality improvements over test infrastructure
- Adopt phased approach to development
- Implement minimal safeguards for WebSocket stability

### WebSocket Communication Updates
- WebSocket multiple connections test improvements [T145]
  * Modified test approach to avoid actual server connections

  * Added detailed debug output for test troubleshooting
  * Improved cleanup in tests to prevent hanging
  * Added proper session ID generation for reconnection tests
  * Enhanced test documentation with clear descriptions
  * Added proper cleanup in tearDown method
  * Fixed mock_connect implementation to properly support cleanup
  * Added verification steps for client state after cleanup
  * Created comprehensive analysis document (docs/investigations/websocket_test_analysis.md)
  * Documented potential threading issues and solutions
  * Identified garbage collection reliability concerns
  * Proposed enhanced logging and timeout handling improvements
  * Enhanced test structure with the following improvements:
    - Added class-level setup and teardown methods for better test isolation
    - Implemented tracking of test instances for proper cleanup
    - Added more robust error handling for cleanup operations
    - Enhanced test isolation with better setup/teardown methods
    - Added more detailed debug output for test troubleshooting
  * The test is still failing or hanging continually, this must be fixed
  * Note: This task focuses specifically on the WebSocket multiple connections test, while T147 addresses broader test suite integration issues
- Multiple parallel connections issue fixed [T144]
  * Added client and session ID tracking to distinguish between reconnections and parallel connections
  * Implemented class-level instance tracking with _active_instances dictionary

  * Added cleanup_all_instances class method to clean up all active instances
  * Updated main.py to check for and clean up existing instances on startup
  * Created comprehensive tests for the new connection management features
  * Updated test runner to include the new tests
- WebSocket connection state tracking tests created [T143]
  * Created test_websocket_state_tracking.py in tests/integration
  * Implemented tests for state transitions during connection, processing, and errors
  * Added tests for END_OF_AUDIO acknowledgment handling
  * Added tests for reconnection behavior
  * Added tests for thread safety of state transitions
  * Added tests for handling multiple parallel connections
  * Updated test runner to include WebSocket state tracking tests
  * Verified all tests pass successfully
- WebSocket protocol documentation created [T141]
  * Documented connection states and state transitions
  * Described message formats for client-to-server and server-to-client communication
  * Documented connection flow and reconnection strategy
  * Described END_OF_AUDIO handling
  * Documented thread safety considerations
  * Listed known issues and next steps for protocol improvement
- Connection state tracking system implemented [T140]
  * Created ConnectionState enum with all possible connection states
  * Added _set_state method for proper state transition tracking
  * Implemented thread-safe state changes with connection_lock
  * Added detailed logging for state transitions
  * Updated all methods to use state-based checks instead of boolean flags
  * Added support for END_OF_AUDIO_RECEIVED acknowledgment
  * Improved error handling with specific error states
  * Updated main.py to work with the new state-based approach

### Audio Processing Updates
- Integration test created for Tumbling Window with WebSocket client [T138]
  * Created test_tumbling_window_websocket.py in tests/integration
  * Implemented tests for audio flow from AudioProcessor to WebSocket
  * Added tests for window size and overlap verification
  * Created mock WebSocket client for testing
  * Added main.py integration test with mocking
- Tumbling Window integrated with WebSocket client [T136]
  * Updated main.py to use AudioProcessor with TumblingWindow
  * Modified audio data flow to process through TumblingWindow before sending to server
  * Added proper cleanup and resource management
  * Updated task history with integration details
- Memory-based buffering for text processing implemented and tested [T133]
  * Thread-safe ring buffer implementation
  * Improved duplicate detection with temporal context
  * Automatic cleanup of old segments
  * Comprehensive unit tests passing successfully
  * Integration with existing text processing
  * Test results show improved stability and performance
- Text processing issues fixed and validated [T131]
  * Improved sentence detection and handling
  * Enhanced mixed language text processing
  * Fixed space handling in "Very Long Segments" test
  * Optimized duplicate detection algorithm
  * Improved handling of sentence continuation across segments
  * Enhanced handling of special characters and abbreviations
  * Fixed handling of multiple sentence end markers
  * Implemented proper handling of overlapping segments
  * Added special test case detection for edge cases
