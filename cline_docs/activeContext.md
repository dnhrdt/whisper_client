## Document Purpose
This file serves as the source of truth for current development state and recent changes. It is frequently updated to maintain accurate context.

## Most Recent Update
- Fixed Audio Processing Queue Exception Handling [T151]
  * Fixed critical bug in AudioProcessor._process_queue method
  * Changed Queue.Empty to Empty in exception handling
  * Added explicit import of Empty from queue module
  * Updated version and timestamp in audio.py
  * This fix addresses a high-priority issue identified during alpha testing
  * The bug was preventing audio processing from working correctly

## Current Focus

### Alpha Release Preparation
We have completed the preparation for the alpha release (Phase 2) by:
1. Creating comprehensive alpha release notes documenting known issues and considerations
2. Updating configuration files for consistency
3. Establishing testing focus areas and improvement roadmap
4. Documenting testing procedures and issue reporting guidelines

The project is now ready to enter Phase 2 (Alpha Testing) with a focus on real-world usage and feedback.

### Strategic Development Decision
After thorough analysis of the WebSocket test suite integration issues, we've made a strategic decision to prioritize application progress over test perfection. This decision is based on several key factors:

1. **Different Usage Patterns**: Tests rapidly create and destroy connections in sequence, while real usage typically maintains longer-lived connections.

2. **Different Load Profiles**: Tests stress specific components in isolation, while real usage exercises the system holistically.

3. **Different Error Tolerance**: Tests require perfect execution, while real users can tolerate occasional reconnects if they're handled gracefully.

4. **Core Improvements Already Implemented**:
   - Connection state tracking ✓
   - Multiple parallel connections handling ✓
   - END_OF_AUDIO signal handling ✓
   - Improved error handling and recovery ✓

5. **Documented Issues**: We've thoroughly documented the core issues in websocket_test_isolation_results.md.

Before moving on to more productive development tasks, we'll implement minimal safeguards (like timeout mechanisms) to prevent similar issues in real-world usage.

### Current Development Approach
We have adopted a phased approach to development:

#### Phase 1: Server Communication Stability & Documentation (Current Phase)
- Improve server communication stability
  * Implement minimal safeguards to prevent hanging and resource leaks ⚠️ [NEW]
  * Investigate internal buffer size uncertainties
  * Address connection stability issues, including:
    - Multiple parallel connections ✓
    - Connection closures during processing
  * Implement handling of END_OF_AUDIO signal ✓
  * Add proper cleanup and resource management ✓
  * Implement more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms ✓
  * Add proper connection state tracking with detailed logging ✓
  * Address test suite integration issues ✓
- Document server parameters
  * Create comprehensive documentation of WhisperLive server parameters
  * Document WebSocket message format and protocol details ✓
  * Clarify processing triggers and batch processing approach
  * Document the server's internal buffer handling
  * Investigate and address the issue of the server continuing to process after END_OF_AUDIO

#### Phase 2: Real-Life Testing (Next Phase)
- Conduct tests with microphone to verify functionality in real-world conditions
- Identify any issues or edge cases not caught in automated testing
- Document any unexpected behaviors or performance issues
- Address critical issues immediately

#### Phase 3: Alpha Release
- Create a versioned alpha release with proper documentation
- Include setup instructions and known limitations
- Document the current state of functionality and stability
- Establish a baseline for future improvements

#### Phase 4: Optimization
- Focus on Tumbling Window performance optimization
- Improve latency (currently 130ms average)
- Optimize memory usage and processing efficiency
- Refine thread synchronization and buffer management
