## Document Purpose
This file serves as the source of truth for current development state and recent changes. It is frequently updated to maintain accurate context.

## Most Recent Update
- Implemented Streamlined Linting System [T156]
  * Created a centralized PowerShell linting script (.linting/lint.ps1)
  * Added configuration files for all linting tools:
    - .editorconfig: Basic editor settings for consistent formatting
    - .flake8: Flake8 configuration with reasonable line length (100)
    - .pylintrc: Comprehensive Pylint configuration with sensible disables
    - .pre-commit-config.yaml: Git hooks for automated checks
    - pyproject.toml: Tool-specific configurations for black, isort, mypy, and pytest
  * Simplified linting workflow with flexible options:
    - Support for running specific linters or all of them
    - Ability to target specific files
    - Fix mode for automatic corrections
    - Clear, color-coded output
  * Created documentation for the linting system in .linting/README.md
  * Next steps: Run the simplified linting script on the codebase and address any remaining issues

- Fixed Additional Linting Issues in WebSocket Module [T156]
  * Fixed trailing whitespace issues in multiple log_connection calls
  * Improved line formatting for long lines to stay within the 100 character limit
  * Fixed a syntax error in the log_connection call at the end of the cleanup method
  * Restructured long string formatting to improve readability
  * Updated version and timestamp in websocket.py
  * All flake8 checks now pass for the main application code
  * Next steps: Continue with remaining linting tools (pylint, black, isort, mypy)

- Fixed Linting Issues for Alpha Release [T156]
  * Ran flake8 on the codebase to identify linting issues
  * Fixed bare except clauses in multiple files:
    - src/websocket.py: Added Exception type to bare except clauses
    - src/text.py: Added Exception type to bare except clauses
  * Fixed unused imports in multiple files:
    - src/audio.py: Removed unused imports (time, collections.deque)
    - src/hotkeys.py: Removed unused import (win32gui)
    - src/text.py: Removed unused imports (Dict, Set from typing)
    - src/__init__.py: Fixed module level import not at top of file and redefinition of logger
  * Fixed line too long issues in multiple files:
    - src/terminal.py: Fixed line too long in error handling
    - src/text.py: Fixed line too long issues in comments and debug logging
  * Updated version and timestamp in all modified files
  * Next steps: Continue with remaining linting tools and verify file headers

## Current Focus

### Alpha Release Preparation
We have created a comprehensive alpha release checklist to prepare for making the project public:

1. Created alpha_release_notes.md documenting known issues and considerations ✓
2. Created alpha_release_checklist.md with detailed preparation tasks ✓
3. Developed a strategic approach for engaging with the WhisperLive team:
   * Address previous issue with more specific information
   * Prepare targeted questions about server behavior
   * Demonstrate our value by showing our implementation
   * Position ourselves as contributors rather than just users

The project is transitioning to Phase 2 (Alpha Testing) with a focus on real-world usage and feedback, but we first need to complete the alpha release checklist to ensure we present a professional, well-organized project.

### Strategic Development Decision
After thorough analysis of the WebSocket test suite integration issues, we've made a strategic decision to prioritize application progress over test perfection. This decision is based on several key factors:

1. **Different Usage Patterns**: Tests rapidly create and destroy connections in sequence, while real usage typically maintains longer-lived connections.

2. **Different Load Profiles**: Tests stress specific components in isolation, while real usage exercises the system holistically.

3. **Different Error Tolerance**: Tests require perfect execution, while real users can tolerate occasional reconnects if they're handled gracefully.

4. **Core Improvements Already Implemented**:
   - Connection state tracking ✓
   - Multiple parallel connections handling ✓
   - END_OF_AUDIO signal handling ✓
   - Improved error handling and recovery ✓

5. **Documented Issues**: We've thoroughly documented the core issues in websocket_test_isolation_results.md.

Before moving on to more productive development tasks, we'll implement minimal safeguards (like timeout mechanisms) to prevent similar issues in real-world usage.

### Current Development Approach
We have adopted a phased approach to development:

#### Phase 1: Server Communication Stability & Documentation (Current Phase)
- Improve server communication stability
  * Implement minimal safeguards to prevent hanging and resource leaks ⚠️ [NEW]
  * Investigate internal buffer size uncertainties
  * Address connection stability issues, including:
    - Multiple parallel connections ✓
    - Connection closures during processing
  * Implement handling of END_OF_AUDIO signal ✓
  * Add proper cleanup and resource management ✓
  * Implement more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms ✓
  * Add proper connection state tracking with detailed logging ✓
  * Address test suite integration issues ✓
- Document server parameters
  * Create comprehensive documentation of WhisperLive server parameters
  * Document WebSocket message format and protocol details ✓
  * Clarify processing triggers and batch processing approach
  * Document the server's internal buffer handling
  * Investigate and address the issue of the server continuing to process after END_OF_AUDIO

#### Phase 2: Real-Life Testing (Next Phase)
- Conduct tests with microphone to verify functionality in real-world conditions
- Identify any issues or edge cases not caught in automated testing
- Document any unexpected behaviors or performance issues
- Address critical issues immediately

#### Phase 3: Alpha Release
- Create a versioned alpha release with proper documentation
- Include setup instructions and known limitations
- Document the current state of functionality and stability
- Establish a baseline for future improvements

#### Phase 4: Optimization
- Focus on Tumbling Window performance optimization
- Improve latency (currently 130ms average)
- Optimize memory usage and processing efficiency
- Refine thread synchronization and buffer management
