## Current Focus

### 0. Strategic Development Decision
After thorough analysis of the WebSocket test suite integration issues, we've made a strategic decision to prioritize application progress over test perfection. This decision is based on several key factors:

1. **Different Usage Patterns**: Tests rapidly create and destroy connections in sequence, while real usage typically maintains longer-lived connections.

2. **Different Load Profiles**: Tests stress specific components in isolation, while real usage exercises the system holistically.

3. **Different Error Tolerance**: Tests require perfect execution, while real users can tolerate occasional reconnects if they're handled gracefully.

4. **Core Improvements Already Implemented**:
   - Connection state tracking ✓
   - Multiple parallel connections handling ✓
   - END_OF_AUDIO signal handling ✓
   - Improved error handling and recovery ✓

5. **Documented Issues**: We've thoroughly documented the core issues in websocket_test_isolation_results.md.

Before moving on to more productive development tasks, we'll implement minimal safeguards (like timeout mechanisms) to prevent similar issues in real-world usage.

### 1. Revised Development Approach
We have adopted a phased approach to development:

#### Phase 1: Server Communication Stability & Documentation
- Improve server communication stability
  * Implement minimal safeguards to prevent hanging and resource leaks ⚠️ [NEW]
  * Investigate internal buffer size uncertainties
  * Address connection stability issues, including:
    - Multiple parallel connections ✓
    - Connection closures during processing
  * Implement handling of END_OF_AUDIO signal ✓
  * Add proper cleanup and resource management ✓
  * Implement more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms ✓
  * Add proper connection state tracking with detailed logging ✓
  * Address test suite integration issues ✓
- Document server parameters
  * Create comprehensive documentation of WhisperLive server parameters
  * Document WebSocket message format and protocol details ✓
  * Clarify processing triggers and batch processing approach
  * Document the server's internal buffer handling
  * Investigate and address the issue of the server continuing to process after END_OF_AUDIO

#### Phase 2: Real-Life Testing
- Conduct tests with microphone to verify functionality in real-world conditions
- Identify any issues or edge cases not caught in automated testing
- Document any unexpected behaviors or performance issues
- Address critical issues immediately

#### Phase 3: Alpha Release
- Create a versioned alpha release with proper documentation
- Include setup instructions and known limitations
- Document the current state of functionality and stability
- Establish a baseline for future improvements

#### Phase 4: Optimization
- Focus on Tumbling Window performance optimization
- Improve latency (currently 130ms average)
- Optimize memory usage and processing efficiency
- Refine thread synchronization and buffer management

This approach ensures we have a solid, stable foundation before investing time in optimization. It also allows us to discover real-world issues through testing that might inform both our stability improvements and later optimization efforts.
