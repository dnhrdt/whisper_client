## Document Purpose
This file serves as the source of truth for current development state and recent changes. It is frequently updated to maintain accurate context.

## Recent Updates
- Documentation migration to English completed
- Memory Bank structure fully implemented
- Config file translated and standardized
- Roadmap updated to version 1.1
- German text removed from active documentation

Note: Historical investigation files and backups maintained in original German for reference purposes.

## Current Focus

### 1. Core Stability
- Server Communication
  * Buffer size optimization needed
  * Processing triggers not documented
  * Batch processing unclear
  * Connection stability improvement

- Audio Processing
  * Tumbling Window validated (130ms latency)
  * Queue-based management planned
  * Audio segmentation in design
  * Performance optimization pending

- Text Output
  * Migration to Windows API planned
  * Memory-based buffering design
  * Current: Clipboard + Ctrl+V
  * Target: SendMessage API

### 2. Phase 1 Implementation
- END_OF_AUDIO Signal [planned]
  * Clean connection termination
  * Signal handling in cleanup
- Server-Ready-Check [planned]
  * Connection stability improvement
  * Pre-recording validation
- Backend configuration preparation
  * TensorRT support groundwork
  * Flexible backend switching

### 3. Performance Research
- Analyzing server parameters (see [T123] in log_001.json)
- Understanding batch processing strategy
- Buffer size optimization needed
- Current blocker: Server communication uncertainties
  * Internal server buffer size unknown
  * Processing triggers not documented
  * Batch processing strategy unclear

### 4. Documentation & Structure
- Memory Bank migration completed
- Moving to Memory Bank structure
- Setting up incremental logging system
- Implementing log rotation
- Logging system refinement ongoing
- Test framework restructuring
- Documentation hierarchy established
- Current status: Initial setup phase

### 5. Test Framework
- Restructuring test architecture
- Implementing timing tests
- Building integration tests
- Latest changes: See [T125] in log_001.json

## Recent Changes

### Documentation Updates
- Core docs translated to English
- New roadmap with metrics established
- Test architecture restructured
- Documentation hierarchy:
  * Technical context defined
  * System patterns documented
  * Product context clarified
  * Progress tracking established
- [T124] Test documentation hierarchy implemented:
  * Overview in test_architecture.md
  * Detailed specs in tests/docs/
  * Clear documentation paths

### Technical Progress
- Timing analysis completed [T123]
- Audio buffer handling improved [T122]
- Log system initiated [T121]
- Development patterns established
- Test framework designed

## Active Work

### Immediate Tasks
0. Task Reference Consolidation (Cline Priority Task)
   * Review all logs for task references
   * Create unified task tracking system
   * Update all documentation with proper references
1. Complete Memory Bank setup
2. Implement timing test framework
3. Document server parameters
4. Adjust client timing
5. Logging system integration
6. Audio processing optimization
7. Windows API migration
8. Test framework implementation

### Required Decisions
- GUI development timeline
- Community engagement approach
- Feature priority post-stability

### Blocking Issues
- Server communication uncertainties
- Audio timing problems [T120]
- Text processing stability issues
- Current investigation in docs/investigations/timing_202502.md

## Development Context

### Current Environment
- Development in VSCode
- WSL for server integration
- Local testing environment
- Docker deployment ready

### Active Test Cases
