## Document Purpose
This file serves as the source of truth for current development state and recent changes. It is frequently updated to maintain accurate context.

## Most Recent Update
- **Addressed Pylint Warnings & Updated Headers [T156] (Current Session):**
  * Addressed specific `pylint` warnings (`W1203`, `I1101`, `R1702`, `C0201`, `W0612`) across multiple Python files.
  * Updated `.pylintrc` to ignore `I1101` for `win32` modules.
  * Refactored code in `src/hotkeys.py` and `src/websocket.py` to resolve `R1702`.
  * Updated `Version` and `Timestamp` headers in all modified Python files.
  * **New Issues:** Final linting run after `black` reformatting revealed new `mypy`/`pylint` errors (`E1205`/`E1121`), likely due to incorrect logging format changes applied to custom helper functions. These need correction in the next session.
  * **Future Task:** Noted user feedback to plan splitting large modules (`text.py`, `websocket.py`).

- Implemented Streamlined Linting System [T156]
  * Created a centralized PowerShell linting script (.linting/lint.ps1)
  * Added configuration files for all linting tools:
    - .editorconfig: Basic editor settings for consistent formatting
    - .flake8: Flake8 configuration with reasonable line length (100)
    - .pylintrc: Comprehensive Pylint configuration with sensible disables
    - .pre-commit-config.yaml: Git hooks for automated checks
    - pyproject.toml: Tool-specific configurations for black, isort, mypy, and pytest
  * Simplified linting workflow with flexible options:
    - Support for running specific linters or all of them
    - Ability to target specific files
    - Fix mode for automatic corrections
    - Clear, color-coded output
  * Created documentation for the linting system in .linting/README.md
  * Next steps: Run the simplified linting script on the codebase and address any remaining issues

- Fixed Additional Linting Issues in WebSocket Module [T156]
  * Fixed trailing whitespace issues in multiple log_connection calls
  * Improved line formatting for long lines to stay within the 100 character limit
  * Fixed a syntax error in the log_connection call at the end of the cleanup method
  * Restructured long string formatting to improve readability
  * Updated version and timestamp in websocket.py
  * All flake8 checks now pass for the main application code
  * Next steps: Continue with remaining linting tools (pylint, black, isort, mypy)

- Fixed Linting Issues for Alpha Release [T156]
  * Ran flake8 on the codebase to identify linting issues
  * Fixed bare except clauses in multiple files:
    - src/websocket.py: Added Exception type to bare except clauses
    - src/text.py: Added Exception type to bare except clauses
  * Fixed unused imports in multiple files:
    - src/audio.py: Removed unused imports (time, collections.deque)
    - src/hotkeys.py: Removed unused import (win32gui)
    - src/text.py: Removed unused imports (Dict, Set from typing)
    - src/__init__.py: Fixed module level import not at top of file and redefinition of logger
  * Fixed line too long issues in multiple files:
    - src/terminal.py: Fixed line too long in error handling
    - src/text.py: Fixed line too long issues in comments and debug logging
  * Updated version and timestamp in all modified files
  * Next steps: Continue with remaining linting tools and verify file headers

## Current Focus

### Alpha Release Preparation
We have created a comprehensive alpha release checklist to prepare for making the project public:

1. Created alpha_release_notes.md documenting known issues and considerations ✓
2. Created alpha_release_checklist.md with detailed preparation tasks ✓
3. Developed a strategic approach for engaging with the WhisperLive team:
   * Address previous issue with more specific information
   * Prepare targeted questions about server behavior
   * Demonstrate our value by showing our implementation
   * Position ourselves as contributors rather than just users

The project is transitioning to Phase 2 (Alpha Testing) with a focus on real-world usage and feedback, but we first need to complete the alpha release checklist to ensure we present a professional, well-organized project.

### Strategic Development Decision
After thorough analysis of the WebSocket test suite integration issues, we've made a strategic decision to prioritize application progress over test perfection. This decision is based on several key factors:

1. **Different Usage Patterns**: Tests rapidly create and destroy connections in sequence, while real usage typically maintains longer-lived connections.

2. **Different Load Profiles**: Tests stress specific components in isolation, while real usage exercises the system holistically.

3. **Different Error Tolerance**: Tests require perfect execution, while real users can tolerate occasional reconnects if they're handled gracefully.

4. **Core Improvements Already Implemented**:
   - Connection state tracking ✓
   - Multiple parallel connections handling ✓
   - END_OF_AUDIO signal handling ✓
   - Improved error handling and recovery ✓

5. **Documented Issues**: We've thoroughly documented the core issues in websocket_test_isolation_results.md.

Before moving on to more productive development tasks, we'll implement minimal safeguards (like timeout mechanisms) to prevent similar issues in real-world usage. ✓

### Strategic Re-evaluation (Post-'Whispering' Analysis)
After analyzing the "Whispering" application (see `research/comparison_whisper_client_vs_whispering.md`), we confirmed that its HTTP POST approach for entire audio files is less suitable for long, continuous dictation compared to our WebSocket streaming approach. However, "Whispering" offers a mature UI, cross-platform support, and backend flexibility.

Given the user's priority for low-latency continuous dictation and the desire for a robust, potentially community-extendable core, we have decided to adopt a **"CLI-First" strategy**:

1.  **Focus on Core:** Prioritize building an extremely stable and robust core library/CLI tool based on our existing Python WebSocket streaming approach.
2.  **Decouple UI:** Separate the core logic cleanly from any UI concerns.
3.  **Attract Developers:** Aim for a well-documented, easy-to-use core that encourages community contributions, potentially including GUIs.
4.  **User Need:** Address the primary need for a reliable dictation tool first, deferring extensive UI development.

### Current Development Approach (Revised: CLI-First)
We adopt a revised phased approach focusing on core stability:

#### Phase 1: Core Stabilization & Refinement (Current Phase)
- **Code Quality:** Complete remaining checks from T156 (Fix new `mypy`/`pylint` errors, verify headers again after fixes).
- **Stability:** Systematically analyze and fix known stability issues (e.g., T120 Audio Timing, WebSocket robustness, error handling, resource management). Ensure reliable long-running operation.
- **Configuration:** Improve configuration handling (e.g., pure JSON/TOML/YAML) for easier CLI/library usage.
- **API/Interface:** Ensure core functions (start, stop, configure) are clearly exposed.
- **Refactoring (Future Task):** Plan to split large modules like `src/text.py` and `src/websocket.py` into smaller, more manageable units.

#### Phase 2: Documentation & Alpha Release (CLI/Library)
- **Documentation:** Create excellent documentation for the core logic, configuration, and API/CLI usage.
- **Release:** Prepare and release a stable alpha/beta version of the core tool.

#### Phase 3: GUI Development (Optional / Community)
- **Decision:** Evaluate the need for a dedicated GUI.
- **Implementation:** Either develop a minimal Python GUI or encourage community contributions based on the stable core.

#### Phase 4: Feature Expansion & Optimization
- **Features:** Iteratively add features inspired by "Whispering" or user requests.
- **Backend Flexibility:** Consider supporting alternative backends (optional, later stage).
- **Optimization:** Continue performance tuning (e.g., TensorRT integration).

## Active Work

### Immediate Tasks (Focus on Core Stability)
1.  **Fix New Linting Errors [T156] (Next Session):**
    *   Run `./.linting/lint.ps1` to confirm the current error state.
    *   Correct the `mypy` (`Too many arguments`) and `pylint` (`E1205`, `E1121`) errors, likely by reverting the logging format changes for custom helper functions (e.g., `log_connection`, `log_audio`) back to f-strings or simple strings.
    *   Address any other remaining `pylint` issues identified in the last run (e.g., `C0209`, `R1702` in `websocket.py`).
    *   Run `./.linting/lint.ps1` again until all tools pass without errors.
    *   Re-verify headers after fixes.
2.  **Plan Module Splitting (Future Task):** Create a new task to address the user feedback regarding splitting `src/text.py` and `src/websocket.py`.
3.  **Core Stability Analysis & Improvement:** (After T156 is fully complete)
    *   Review and address known stability concerns (T120, WebSocket connection handling, error recovery, resource leaks).
    *   Conduct tests focused on long-running stability.

### Required Decisions
- Prioritization of stability issues after linting is complete.
- Strategy and specific breakdown for splitting `text.py` and `websocket.py`.
- Best format for configuration files (evaluation deferred).

### Blocking Issues
- Newly introduced linting errors prevent a clean state.
- Underlying stability concerns (T120, WebSocket, Text Processing) need addressing after linting.

## Development Context

### Current Environment

- Historical context: archiveContext.md
- Task history: progressHistory.md

## Next Steps (Immediate for New Session)
1.  **Fix New Linting Errors [T156]:** Execute `./.linting/lint.ps1`, analyze errors (likely related to logging arguments), fix them in the affected files (esp. `src/websocket.py`), and re-run the script until clean.
2.  **Verify Headers:** Briefly re-check headers in files modified during the fix process.
3.  **Proceed with Stability Analysis:** Once T156 is truly complete, move to the next core stabilization tasks.
4.  **Prioritize Stability:** Begin systematic review and improvement of core component stability (Audio, WebSocket, Text Processing, Error Handling).

*(Community engagement, WhisperLive communication, and broader Alpha testing are deferred until the core CLI/library is stable and documented.)*
