## Current Focus

### 0. Revised Development Approach
We have adopted a phased approach to development:

#### Phase 1: Server Communication Stability & Documentation
- Improve server communication stability
  * Investigate internal buffer size uncertainties
  * Address connection stability issues, including:
    - Multiple parallel connections
    - Connection closures during processing
  * Implement handling of END_OF_AUDIO signal
  * Add proper cleanup and resource management
  * Implement more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
  * Add proper connection state tracking with detailed logging
- Document server parameters
  * Create comprehensive documentation of WhisperLive server parameters
  * Document WebSocket message format and protocol details
  * Clarify processing triggers and batch processing approach
  * Document the server's internal buffer handling
  * Investigate and address the issue of the server continuing to process after END_OF_AUDIO

#### Phase 2: Real-Life Testing
- Conduct tests with microphone to verify functionality in real-world conditions
- Identify any issues or edge cases not caught in automated testing
- Document any unexpected behaviors or performance issues
- Address critical issues immediately

#### Phase 3: Alpha Release
- Create a versioned alpha release with proper documentation
- Include setup instructions and known limitations
- Document the current state of functionality and stability
- Establish a baseline for future improvements

#### Phase 4: Optimization
- Focus on Tumbling Window performance optimization
- Improve latency (currently 130ms average)
- Optimize memory usage and processing efficiency
- Refine thread synchronization and buffer management

This approach ensures we have a solid, stable foundation before investing time in optimization. It also allows us to discover real-world issues through testing that might inform both our stability improvements and later optimization efforts.
