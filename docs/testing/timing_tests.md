# WhisperClient Timing Test Design
Version: 1.0
Timestamp: 2025-02-26 21:11 CET

## Purpose
Create reproducible timing tests using pre-recorded German audio to:
1. Establish minimum stable delays
2. Verify server response patterns
3. Validate text completion

## Test Components

### 1. Test Audio Resource
```
tests/
└── timing/
    └── resources/
        ├── test_2sec.wav     # Clear 2-second German test phrase
        ├── test_markers.json # Timing markers
        └── expected.json     # Expected German outputs
```

### 2. Test Framework
```python
class TimingTest:
    """
    Systematic timing tests using pre-recorded German audio
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.audio_file = "tests/timing/resources/test_2sec.wav"
        self.markers = load_markers()
        self.results = []
        
    def run_timing_matrix(self):
        """Run tests with different delay configurations"""
        pass
        
    def analyze_results(self):
        """Analyze and visualize timing results"""
        pass
```

### 3. Result Collection
- Timestamps for all events
- Audio transmission status
- Server response patterns
- Text completion status
- German text validation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup (1 day)
1. Create German test audio file
2. Build basic test framework
3. Implement logging
4. Define German text validation rules

### Phase 2: Testing (2-3 days)
1. Run timing matrix
2. Collect detailed logs
3. Analyze patterns
4. Validate German text output

### Phase 3: Optimization (2-3 days)
1. Implement findings
2. Verify improvements
3. Document results
4. Update WhisperServer parameters if needed
5. Fine-tune German recognition timing

## Success Metrics
1. Reproducible results
2. Stable German text output
3. Minimal delays
4. No text truncation
5. Accurate German word boundaries

## Integration Points
- Add to CI/CD pipeline
- Regular regression testing
- Performance monitoring
- German text validation pipeline

## Notes
- Keep test audio under 8KB
- Use clear German pronunciation in test audio
- Log all WebSocket frames
- Monitor server CPU/memory
- Document all timing assumptions
- Ensure test phrases cover German phonetics

## Test Audio Requirements
1. **Content**
   - Clear German pronunciation
   - Standard German dialect
   - Common sentence structures
   - Various sentence lengths

2. **Technical**
   - 16kHz sample rate
   - 16-bit PCM
   - Mono channel
   - Clear start/end markers

3. **Validation**
   - Reference transcriptions
   - Word-level timing markers
   - Sentence boundary markers
   - Expected server responses

## Priority in Roadmap
This should be completed before:
1. GUI development
2. Multi-language support
3. Advanced features

## Next Steps
1. Create German test audio file
2. Basic test harness
3. Initial timing tests
4. Results analysis
5. German text validation framework

## Language Considerations
While timing tests focus on technical performance, using German test audio ensures:
1. Real-world performance metrics
2. Language-specific timing patterns
3. Accurate word boundary detection
4. Representative server load
5. Valid text segmentation testing
