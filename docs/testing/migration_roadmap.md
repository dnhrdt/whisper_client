# Test Migration Roadmap
Version: 1.2
Timestamp: 2025-02-27 00:15 CET

## Testing Philosophy
> "The test framework is a tool, not a deliverable"

This axiom guides our migration approach. We focus on:
1. Essential testing over comprehensive coverage
2. Pragmatic solutions over perfect architecture
3. Manual verification where appropriate
4. Minimal maintenance overhead

## Purpose
This document tracks the migration of tests to the new structure. It will be archived once the migration is complete, at which point regular development can continue.

## Migration Status

### Phase 1: Documentation & Planning ✓
1. Documentation Structure ✓
   - Created /docs/testing/ directory
   - Moved and updated all documentation files
   - Added proper version headers
   - Ensured German language focus

2. Directory Structure ✓
   - Created test directories
   - Added README files
   - Documented test purposes

3. Test Inventory ✓
   - [x] Create inventory of existing tests
   - [x] Document test purposes and dependencies
   - [x] Identify gaps in test coverage
   - [x] Map tests to new structure

### Phase 2: Basic Reorganization (IN PROGRESS)
1. File Migration ✓
   - [x] Move test_server_flow.py → tests/timing/
   - [x] Move test_text_processing.py → tests/integration/
   - [x] Move test_prompt_output.py → tests/integration/
   - [x] Move timing_tests.py → tests/timing/
   - [x] Update import statements
   - [x] Standardize language usage:
     * Documentation in English
     * German docstrings preserved
     * Test output messages in English
     * German speech test cases preserved
   - [x] Verify all files work in new locations
   - [x] Final comparison with original files
   - [x] Remove original files after verification

2. POC Integration ✓
   - [x] Review POC implementations
   - [x] Document integration points (see poc_integration.md)
   - [x] Plan implementation in main tests

### Phase 3: Simplified Test Runner (IN PROGRESS)
1. Essential Test Runner
   - [ ] Create minimal run_tests.py
   - [ ] Add basic category support
   - [ ] Maintain timing test functionality
   - [ ] Keep configuration simple

2. Test Runner Documentation
   - [ ] Document basic usage
   - [ ] Provide example commands
   - [ ] List supported options

### Phase 4: Essential Tests (TODO)
1. Priority 1: Timing Tests
   - [ ] Verify test_server_flow.py functionality
   - [ ] Ensure timing_tests.py works correctly
   - [ ] Document any timing issues found

2. Priority 2: Integration Tests
   - [ ] Verify test_text_processing.py
   - [ ] Verify test_prompt_output.py
   - [ ] Document integration points

3. Additional Tests
   - [ ] Add only if specific issues arise
   - [ ] Focus on problem-solving
   - [ ] Keep maintenance minimal
   - [ ] Consult test_catalog.md for ideas

Note: Additional test ideas and potential test cases are preserved in test_catalog.md. These should be implemented only when they help solve specific problems, following our "test framework as a tool" philosophy.

## Blocking Issues
- All test migration must be complete before new development
- Test inventory must be completed to ensure no functionality is lost
- All tests must pass in new structure before migration is complete

## Success Criteria
1. Essential tests working in new structure
2. Basic test runner functional
3. Critical paths verified
4. Documentation clear and minimal
5. Original files archived
6. POC tests preserved for reference

## Verification Process
1. Keep original files for reference
2. Compare new files with originals:
   - Line by line comparison
   - Functionality verification
   - Import path validation
3. Document any discrepancies
4. Only remove originals after full verification

## Current Focus
1. Create minimal test runner
2. Document basic usage
3. Verify essential tests
4. Complete migration efficiently

## Next Steps
1. Implement simplified test runner
2. Document usage and examples
3. Verify critical tests
4. Archive migration roadmap

## Note
This document serves as a blocker for regular development. Once all items are checked off and the migration is complete, this document will be archived and regular development can resume.

## Migration Completion Checklist
- [x] All Phase 1 items complete
- [x] All Phase 2 items complete (File Migration ✓, POC Integration ✓)
- [ ] All Phase 3 items complete
- [ ] All Phase 4 items complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [x] Documentation updated
- [ ] No remaining TODOs
- [ ] Team sign-off

Once all items above are checked, this document can be archived and regular development can resume.
