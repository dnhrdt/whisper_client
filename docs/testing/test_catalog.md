# Test Catalog
Version: 1.1
Timestamp: 2025-02-27 00:45 CET

## Purpose
This document serves as a catalog of test ideas and potential test cases. While following our axiom "the test framework is a tool, not a deliverable", we maintain this catalog as a reference for when specific testing needs arise. Tests should be implemented from this catalog only when they help solve concrete problems.

## Implementation Notes

### When to Implement
1. When specific issues arise that need investigation
2. When manual testing becomes insufficient
3. When reproducing issues requires automation
4. When timing analysis is needed
5. When regression testing becomes necessary

### Implementation Priority
1. Implement only tests that:
   - Address current issues
   - Verify critical functionality
   - Help debug complex problems
   - Measure important metrics

2. Avoid implementing tests that:
   - Test obvious functionality
   - Can be verified manually
   - Have high maintenance cost
   - Don't address real issues

## Usage Guide

1. **Problem Investigation**
   - Consult this catalog when issues arise
   - Find relevant test ideas
   - Adapt tests to current needs
   - Implement minimal necessary subset

2. **Test Development**
   - Start with manual verification
   - Move to automated tests if needed
   - Keep tests focused and minimal
   - Document test purpose clearly

3. **Maintenance**
   - Remove tests that no longer serve a purpose
   - Update catalog with new test ideas
   - Document successful test patterns
   - Share learning from implementations

Note: This catalog is a living document. Add new test ideas as they arise, but remember our axiom: implement tests only when they serve as tools to solve specific problems.
