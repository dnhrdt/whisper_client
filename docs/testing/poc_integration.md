## Testing Philosophy
> "The test framework is a tool, not a deliverable"

This axiom guides our POC integration approach:
1. Focus on implementing core functionality first
2. Add tests only where necessary
3. Prefer manual verification for straightforward features
4. Keep test framework minimal and maintainable

## Overview
This document outlines our research and development strategy, with discovered POC implementations serving as valuable reference material rather than prescriptive solutions.

## Development Philosophy
1. Research before implementation
2. Consider multiple approaches
3. Make informed decisions
4. Build incrementally
5. Test pragmatically

## Development Strategy

1. Complete Test Migration
   - Finish test framework simplification
   - Document testing approach
   - Establish verification methods

2. Research Phase
   - Review existing POC implementations
   - Study other Whisper-based applications:
     * collabora-whisperlive
     * dariox1337-whisper-writer
     * dimastatz-whisper-flow
     * foges-whisper-dictation
     * qasax-whisperlive-systemaudio
     * redocrepus-ahk-whisper-paste
     * savbell-whisper-writer
   - Compare approaches and solutions
   - Document findings and insights
   - Consider alternative architectures

3. Development Planning
   - Evaluate research findings
   - Prioritize functionality needs:
     * Core audio processing
     * Text output reliability
     * Error handling
     * Performance optimization
   - Focus on stability requirements
   - Plan optimization strategy
   - Make informed implementation decisions

4. Implementation Approach
   - Start with core functionality
   - Build stable foundation
   - Add features incrementally
   - Optimize based on real usage
   - Test where it adds value

## Discovered Solutions (Reference)
Note: These implementations represent valuable discoveries but should not constrain our exploration of other approaches.

### 1. Tumbling Window Approach
Found in tests/poc/test_tumbling_window.py
- Achieved 130ms latency
- Uses overlapping windows
- Stable processing observed
- Real-time capable

### 2. Queue-based Management
Found in tests/poc/test_queue_chunks.py
- Thread and async options
- Structured data model
- Error handling patterns
- WebSocket integration

### 3. Audio Segmentation
Found in tests/poc/test_segmentation.py
- Energy-based detection
- Configurable parameters
- Real-time processing
- Padding mechanisms

## Success Criteria

1. Research & Planning
   - Comprehensive understanding of options
   - Clear development direction
   - Informed technical decisions
   - Documented alternatives
   - Evaluated multiple approaches

2. Core Functionality
   - Reliable audio processing
   - Stable text output
   - Acceptable latency
   - Error resilience
   - Maintainable codebase

3. Documentation
   - Research findings
   - Design decisions
   - Implementation notes
   - Usage guidelines
   - Alternative approaches considered

## Next Steps

1. Complete test migration
2. Research similar applications in depth
3. Document findings and options
4. Compare different approaches
5. Plan development strategy

Note: Our goal is to make informed decisions based on comprehensive research, not to simply implement the first working solution we discovered.
