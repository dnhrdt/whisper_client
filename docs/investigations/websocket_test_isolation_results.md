# WebSocket Test Isolation Results
Version: 1.0
Timestamp: 2025-03-03 20:56 CET

## Overview

This document contains the results of running the WebSocket multiple connections tests in isolation. The goal is to identify which tests pass when run individually and which tests fail or hang, to better understand the test suite integration issues.

## Test Results

| Test Name | Result | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| test_client_and_session_ids | ✅ Pass | Verified in previous session |
| test_instance_tracking | ✅ Pass | Verified in previous session |
| test_cleanup_all_instances | ✅ Pass | Completes successfully |
| test_connection_throttling | ✅ Pass | Completes successfully |
| test_parallel_connections | ⚠️ Hang | Test logic completes but hangs during tearDown |
| test_reconnection_with_new_session | ✅ Pass | Completes successfully |

## Detailed Analysis

### test_parallel_connections

This test hangs during the tearDown phase. The test itself completes successfully (as indicated by "DEBUG: test_parallel_connections completed"), but then it hangs during the cleanup process in the tearDown method.

The issue appears to be in the tearDown method when it's trying to force cleanup of the instances. It's able to identify that there are 2 instances still active after cleanup, and it attempts to force cleanup of those instances, but then it hangs.

From the log:
```
DEBUG: test_parallel_connections completed
DEBUG: Tearing down test: test_parallel_connections
DEBUG: Cleaned up all instances
WARNING: 2 instances still active after cleanup
DEBUG: Forcing cleanup of instance 3d6e7ebd-1bb3-472e-a032-bd585e26cbec
DEBUG: Forcing cleanup of instance 4b9d5cc9-0a8d-4ad3-8b57-16340598f6c7
```

After this point, the test hangs and doesn't complete.

## Common Patterns

1. **Instance Cleanup Issues**: All tests show warnings about instances still being active after cleanup, but most tests are able to force cleanup successfully. Only test_parallel_connections hangs during this process.

2. **State Transitions**: All tests follow a similar pattern of state transitions:
   - DISCONNECTED -> CONNECTING -> CONNECTED -> READY (during connect)
   - READY -> CLOSING -> DISCONNECTED (during cleanup)

3. **Mock WebSocket Behavior**: The mock WebSocket implementation appears to work correctly for most tests, but there might be an issue with how it handles parallel connections.

## Implications for Test Suite Integration

When running the tests as a suite, the hanging behavior of test_parallel_connections would prevent subsequent tests from running. Additionally, if instances aren't properly cleaned up between tests, this could lead to interference between tests.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix test_parallel_connections**: Investigate why this test hangs during tearDown. Possible issues:
   - Race condition in the cleanup process
   - Deadlock when cleaning up multiple instances simultaneously
   - Issue with the mock WebSocket implementation

2. **Improve Instance Tracking**: Enhance the instance tracking mechanism to ensure all instances are properly cleaned up between tests.

3. **Add Timeout Handling**: Implement timeout handling in the tearDown method to prevent tests from hanging indefinitely.

4. **Enhance Logging**: Add more detailed logging during the cleanup process to better understand what's happening when tests hang.

5. **Consider Test Isolation**: Run tests in separate processes to ensure complete isolation between tests.

## Next Steps

1. Investigate the specific issue with test_parallel_connections by adding more detailed logging during the tearDown phase.
2. Implement a timeout mechanism in the tearDown method to prevent tests from hanging indefinitely.
3. Enhance the instance tracking mechanism to ensure all instances are properly cleaned up between tests.
4. Consider refactoring the test approach to better handle asynchronous behavior.
