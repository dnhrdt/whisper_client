# Alpha Release Notes
Version: 1.0
Timestamp: 2025-03-07 21:32 CET

## Overview

This document outlines the current state of the WhisperClient project as it enters Phase 2 (Alpha Testing). It documents known issues, potential improvements, and provides guidance for testing and future development.

## Current Status

The WhisperClient is now ready for alpha testing with the following core functionality implemented:

- Real-time audio capture from microphone
- Audio processing with Tumbling Window approach
- WebSocket communication with WhisperLive server
- Text processing and output to active applications
- Hotkey control (F13/F14)
- Comprehensive logging system

## Known Issues and Considerations

Based on a comprehensive code review, the following potential issues have been identified:

### High Priority (Address Before/During Alpha)

1. **Audio Device Handling**
   - No explicit error handling for device disconnection during recording
   - Could cause crashes in real-world usage
   - **Recommendation**: Implement robust device disconnection detection and recovery

2. **WebSocket Message Validation**
   - Limited validation of server message format
   - Only processes the last segment from each message, potentially losing information
   - **Recommendation**: Add basic validation to prevent crashes with unexpected server responses

3. **Resource Cleanup**
   - Some cleanup operations don't have proper timeout handling
   - Could lead to hanging during shutdown
   - **Recommendation**: Implement timeout handling for all cleanup operations

### Medium Priority (Monitor During Alpha Testing)

1. **Audio Processing Efficiency**
   - The `resample_to_16kHZ` function converts from float32 to bytes and back (inefficient)
   - Buffer management in `_record_audio` creates a new buffer for each chunk
   - **Recommendation**: Monitor performance and optimize if issues are observed

2. **Thread Safety**
   - Locks are held during potentially long operations in some places
   - Could cause UI freezing or responsiveness issues
   - **Recommendation**: Monitor for freezing issues during testing

3. **Configuration Inconsistencies**
   - Discrepancy between `config.py` and `config.json`
   - `config.json` specifies `"chunk_size": 1024` while `config.py` uses `AUDIO_CHUNK = 4096`
   - `config.json` sets `"output_mode": "prompt"` but `config.py` uses `OUTPUT_MODE = OutputMode.SENDMESSAGE`
   - **Recommendation**: Update `config.json` to match `config.py` for consistency

### Low Priority (Post-Alpha Improvements)

1. **Text Processing Complexity**
   - Extensive special case handling makes the code complex
   - VS Code edit control detection is complex and might break with updates
   - Duplicate detection algorithm might be too aggressive for certain use cases
   - **Recommendation**: Refactor and simplify after gathering real-world usage data

2. **Configuration System**
   - Dual configuration files (`config.py` and `config.json`) could lead to confusion
   - **Recommendation**: Implement a unified configuration system that loads from JSON

3. **WebSocket Implementation Refinements**
   - Focus heavily on reconnection but less on handling server-side errors
   - **Recommendation**: Enhance error handling based on testing feedback

## Testing Focus Areas

During alpha testing, focus on the following areas:

1. **Stability**
   - Long-running sessions (30+ minutes)
   - Recovery from network interruptions
   - Handling of server restarts
   - Proper cleanup on exit

2. **Audio Processing**
   - Quality of transcription with different speech patterns
   - Performance with background noise
   - Handling of microphone disconnection/reconnection
   - CPU and memory usage during extended sessions

3. **Text Output**
   - Accuracy of text insertion in different applications
   - Handling of different window types
   - Performance of SendMessage API vs. clipboard methods
   - Sentence boundary detection and formatting

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Response to server errors
   - Recovery from connection loss
   - Handling of invalid server responses
   - Resource cleanup after errors

## Immediate Next Steps

Before proceeding with full alpha testing, the following immediate steps should be addressed:

1. **Implement Minimal Safeguards in WebSocket Implementation [T150]**
   - Add global timeout mechanism to all blocking operations
   - Implement timeout for cleanup process to prevent hanging
   - Add timeout handling for connection establishment and message processing
   - Enhance error logging around resource acquisition and release
   - Implement periodic state logging during long-running operations
   - Ensure graceful degradation with automatic reconnection
   - Add basic resource usage logging

2. **Improve Server Communication Stability**
   - Investigate and fix connection closures during processing
   - Implement more robust error handling for server-side errors
   - Enhance validation of server responses

3. **Document Server Parameters**
   - Create comprehensive documentation of WhisperLive server parameters
   - Clarify processing triggers and batch processing approach
   - Document the server's internal buffer handling
   - Investigate and address the issue of the server continuing to process after END_OF_AUDIO

4. **Final Preparation for Phase 2 (Real-Life Testing)**
   - Run integration tests to verify current functionality
   - Extend text processing tests for new features
   - Conduct tests with microphone to verify functionality in real-world conditions

## Post-Alpha Improvement Roadmap

Based on the analysis, here's a proposed roadmap for post-alpha improvements:

### Phase 1: Stability Enhancements
- Address high-priority issues identified during alpha testing
- Implement robust error recovery mechanisms
- Enhance resource cleanup and management
- Improve logging for better diagnostics

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization
- Optimize audio processing chain
- Improve memory usage and buffer management
- Enhance thread synchronization
- Optimize text processing for speed

### Phase 3: Usability Improvements
- Implement unified configuration system
- Simplify text processing logic
- Enhance VS Code integration
- Improve user feedback mechanisms

### Phase 4: Feature Expansion
- Add support for additional languages
- Implement custom hotkey configuration
- Add user interface for settings
- Explore additional output methods
