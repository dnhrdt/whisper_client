# Alpha Release Checklist
Version: 1.0
Timestamp: 2025-03-07 23:55 CET

## Purpose

This document outlines the necessary tasks to complete before making the WhisperClient project public as an alpha release. It ensures we present a professional, well-organized project that properly acknowledges WhisperLive while positioning ourselves as serious contributors who can add value to the ecosystem.

## Task Tracking [T156]

### 1. Repository Cleanup

- [ ] Review and update `.gitignore` to ensure it includes:
  * `/backup/` directory
  * Any other sensitive or unnecessary files
  * Temporary files, cache directories, etc.
- [ ] Remove any sensitive information from commit history (if applicable)
- [ ] Ensure no API keys or credentials are in the codebase
- [ ] Verify all files have appropriate line endings (LF for code, CRLF for Windows scripts)

### 2. Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update README.md to:
  * Properly attribute WhisperLive with prominent mention
  * Clarify that this is an alpha release
  * Add specific instructions for German speech recognition
  * Include link to alpha_release_notes.md
  * Update any outdated information
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors
- [ ] Add CHANGELOG.md to track version changes
- [ ] Update any outdated documentation
- [ ] Ensure Memory Bank documentation is up-to-date and consistent

### 3. Configuration Consistency

- [ ] Fix the configuration inconsistencies mentioned in alpha_release_notes.md:
  * Update `config.json` to match `config.py` for consistency
  * Fix chunk_size (1024 → 4096)
  * Update output_mode (prompt → sendmessage)
  * Update timestamp to reflect current state

### 4. Code Quality Checks

- [ ] Run linting tools to ensure code quality
- [ ] Verify all files have proper headers and documentation
- [ ] Check for any TODO comments that should be addressed
- [ ] Ensure consistent code style throughout
- [ ] Verify all minimal safeguards in WebSocket implementation are working

### 5. Testing

- [ ] Run all existing tests to verify functionality
- [ ] Test with real microphone input to confirm basic functionality
- [ ] Verify error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Test long-running sessions (10+ minutes)
- [ ] Document any issues found during testing

### 6. Community Preparation

- [ ] Set up issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- [ ] Create a project board for tracking alpha feedback
- [ ] Prepare a simple feedback form for alpha testers
- [ ] Draft guidelines for alpha testers

### 7. WhisperLive Attribution and Communication

- [ ] Add prominent attribution to WhisperLive in:
  * README.md (already exists but could be enhanced)
  * Documentation files
  * Source code headers
- [ ] Prepare specific questions for the WhisperLive team about:
  * Server buffer handling
  * Processing triggers
  * END_OF_AUDIO handling
  * Connection management
- [ ] Draft a respectful and detailed response to the previous issue

## Next Steps After Checklist Completion

Once we complete this checklist:

1. Address the previous issue in the WhisperLive repository with more details
2. Make the repository public or share with selected alpha testers
3. Submit our specific questions to the WhisperLive team
4. Begin collecting feedback from alpha testing

## Specific Questions for WhisperLive Team

These questions will be refined and submitted to the WhisperLive team after addressing our previous issue:

1. **Server Buffer Handling**
   - "We've observed X behavior when sending audio chunks of size Y. Is there an optimal chunk size or buffer management strategy?"
   - "Does the server have internal buffer size limitations we should be aware of?"

2. **Processing Triggers**
   - "We're trying to optimize when to send audio chunks. Does the server process immediately or batch until a certain threshold?"
   - "Are there specific timing considerations for optimal transcription quality?"

3. **END_OF_AUDIO Handling**
   - "We've noticed the server continues processing after END_OF_AUDIO. Is there a way to know when processing is truly complete?"
   - "Is there a server acknowledgment for END_OF_AUDIO that we should be waiting for?"

4. **Connection Management**
   - "We've implemented state tracking with 11 states (diagram included). Does this align with the server's expected client behavior?"
   - "Are there recommended practices for handling reconnection scenarios?"

## Conclusion

This checklist ensures we address all necessary aspects before making the WhisperClient project public. By following this structured approach, we can present a professional project that properly acknowledges its foundation while demonstrating our commitment to quality and collaboration.
