# WhisperClient Timing Test Design

## Purpose
Create reproducible timing tests using pre-recorded audio to:
1. Establish minimum stable delays
2. Verify server response patterns
3. Validate text completion

## Test Components

### 1. Test Audio Resource
```
tests/
└── resources/
    ├── test_2sec.wav     # Clear 2-second test phrase
    ├── test_markers.json # Timing markers
    └── expected.json     # Expected outputs
```

### 2. Test Framework
```python
class TimingTest:
    """
    Systematic timing tests using pre-recorded audio
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.audio_file = "tests/resources/test_2sec.wav"
        self.markers = load_markers()
        self.results = []
        
    def run_timing_matrix(self):
        """Run tests with different delay configurations"""
        pass
        
    def analyze_results(self):
        """Analyze and visualize timing results"""
        pass
```

### 3. Result Collection
- Timestamps for all events
- Audio transmission status
- Server response patterns
- Text completion status

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup (1 day)
1. Create test audio file
2. Build basic test framework
3. Implement logging

### Phase 2: Testing (2-3 days)
1. Run timing matrix
2. Collect detailed logs
3. Analyze patterns

### Phase 3: Optimization (2-3 days)
1. Implement findings
2. Verify improvements
3. Document results
4. Update WhisperServer parameters if needed

## Success Metrics
1. Reproducible results
2. Stable text output
3. Minimal delays
4. No text truncation

## Integration Points
- Add to CI/CD pipeline
- Regular regression testing
- Performance monitoring

## Notes
- Keep test audio under 8KB
- Log all WebSocket frames
- Monitor server CPU/memory
- Document all timing assumptions

## Priority in Roadmap
This should be completed before:
1. GUI development
2. Multi-language support
3. Advanced features

## Next Steps
1. Create test audio file
2. Basic test harness
3. Initial timing tests
4. Results analysis
