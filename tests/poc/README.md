## Purpose
This directory contains proof of concept implementations that validate core technical approaches for the WhisperClient system. These tests serve as reference implementations and technical validation for key system components.

## Documentation
Related documentation can be found in:
- [Test Architecture](../../docs/testing/test_architecture.md)
- [Timing Tests Documentation](../../docs/testing/timing_tests.md)

## Test Components

### Tumbling Window (test_tumbling_window.py)
- Window-based audio processing
- 130ms average latency
- Stable processing (27 windows/3.5s)
- Overlapping windows for transitions
- Status: Ready for implementation

### Queue-based Chunk Management (test_queue_chunks.py)
- Thread and async implementations
- AudioChunk data model with metadata
- Enhanced WebSocket integration
- Status: Conceptually validated

### Audio Segmentation (test_segmentation.py)
- Speech segment detection
- Energy-based classification
- Parameter optimization
- Status: Partially validated

## Running Tests
